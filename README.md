The code simulates a bidding process where participants enter their names and bid amounts. It maintains a list called bit_list to store bidder information, including the bidderâ€™s name and their bid amount. The program prompts users to input their names and bids, allowing them to continue adding bidders or exit the loop. As bids are entered, the highest bid amount and the corresponding bidder are tracked. Finally, the program prints the highest bid and announces the winning bidder. This straightforward system can be used for various auction scenarios or competitive events. ðŸ˜ŠðŸ’°
